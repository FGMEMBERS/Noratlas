Thanks for using that Aircraft.

Could you notice, that Nord 2502 model is under construction, the Panel and the FDM are wrong.


in order to give quickly a model flyable with FlightGear:

1/ I am working on the 3D panel, my goal is to offer the right instruments at the right place, now we have only some instruments, which may help to fly that aircraft.

2/ 	I have  built an FDM from Aeromatic, even if the parameters which are given by Aeromatic are reprensentative, that FDM must be tuned according to the real aircraft specifications 


Regards 

GÃ©rard Robin.
